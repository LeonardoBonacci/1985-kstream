# Heroes - Anonymous token exchange service that aims to aid local communities in experimenting with alternative forms of value exchange


Community currencies need some more thought in practice

So why do they flop? Some don’t survive the loss of activist leadership. Others fail to scale for a different reason. “People don’t understand money,”

Sardex - The credits are denominated in Euro but cannot be exchanged for Euro or bought with Euro

## Interesting for...

Local communities
Social initiatives
Anyone who wants to create a local currency
Any game/virual... that uses a currency
A token value can represent hours too

## Basic concepts

an administrator creates an empty pool

there are different types of pools
1 sardex

TODO something about tokens?

the admin can invite/accept members to the pool

a pool-member can exchange tokens within the pool

each pool-member has a balance, represented in pool-tokens
pool-members can transfer tokens to each other - given that they have enough balance for the transfer
in Sardex the balance can be negative

there can be no cross-pool exchange

### The ordinary user

needs to install a phone-app

requests the admin to be added to a pool

acquiring tokens depends on the pool type - i.e. request the admin

uses the phone-app to transfer tokens to other members of the pool

### The admin

needs to install a phone-app

creates a pool - financial implications (payment depends on pool type)

allows or rejects people/members to its pool

depending on the pool-type, allows or rejects the acquisition of tokens by its pool-members

### The platform

the platform offers people/members a shielded realm to exchange tokens with other members in the form of pools

different types of pools maintain different member-entrance and token-acquisition policies - with different roles to play for the admin


## Philosophy - design implications

The exchange platform is intended for informal exchange among friends

The value of token depends on the acquisition, but it is mostly a natural process, as a private concern of the pool-members. In fact,
the comparison, or monetary-description/representation, has no real meaning, and is only used as a way to purchase tokens.

Pool token size can only grow, tokens can not be taken out. Depending on how the pool is managed, the token-value does not decrease over time, unless it's reflects the pool-members' exchange behaviour.

Do not buy more tokens than you can miss!

A member cannot transfer an amount larger than its balance

A member can transfer at maximum once a minute

There are no guarantees (at first)

The members pay for the platform usage, either by a monthly pool contribution or financed by the token purchase - depends on the pool type
